                This is happened when i was a senior year at SMA 24 Jakarta. I was the captain of my basketball team.<br>
                And our 2 best players must absent. Their name is Arvi and Patrick. Arvi cannot take part in the competition because <br>
                he participating a student exchange program to Minnesota, United States. and Patrick had a motorcycle accident.<br>
                Our opponent is SMA 3 Tanggerang.</p>
                <br>

                <p>
                Its time for the tip-off. SMA 3 win the jump ball then they immediately attack our rim and they get their first point.<br>
                it's difficult for us to get our first points. The score already 11-0. But, before the first quarter ended, i make my shot<br>
                and get the first points for our team. First quarter result is 11-2 for SMA 3. The second quarter begin, our willingness to win<br>
                is very high. in the second quarter we played well and the result is 20-15 for SMA 3. In the third quarter, the match began to fierce,<br>
                both team reciprocated each other to score points. Quarter 3 result is 28-25 for SMA 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                Fourth quarter begin. Our opponent seems exhausted. We take it as an advantage. We playing a solid defense that makes their team frustrated.<br>
                in the last 30 seconds of fourth quarter, the score is tied 35-35. i was driving to the basket, and i got fouled. the referee gave us 2 free throws<br>
                i missed the first shot and i make the second shot. it is our first lead, we back to defense and SMA 3 get the ball possessions. When they <br>
                entered our territory, SMA 3's playmaker passing the ball to man that i guard and i steal the ball and attack their basket and one of their players<br>
                tried to foul me when i shoot the ball and boom. The ball going in and i got the foul. so that is foul-in. I got one free throw and make it. so that is<br>
                3 points play. 2 points from my shot and 1 points from my free throw in the last 3 seconds of the game. The crowd go crazy, and they inbound the ball, finally,<br>
                the final buzzer sounded. What a game. I just played full times 40 minutes and not benched-up during the match. i'm so exhausted back then.<br>
                But, the process will not betray the results. The final score is 35-39 for SMA 24 Jakarta.
